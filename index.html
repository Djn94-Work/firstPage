        <h3>In the beginning</h3><p> I was born in Houston, 
        Texas and have lived on the south side my entire life. 
        My younger days were filled with musical studies and 
        performances that led me to most states in the country,
        and much of who I am today is owed to the fine educators and
        mentors I was lucky to be placed under the tutelage of. 
        Originally, I began learning guitar as a child, but soon after 
        picked up the clarinet for school, where I also taught myself tuba
        (the key to my touring the country) and switched permanently 
        from guitar to bass, which is primarily what 
        I perform on now-a-days around Houston (and sometimes San Antonio or San Angelo). 
        I've experienced an amazing variety of ensemble to participate in, including but not limited to:

        Coding is an enjoyable experience for me. I've always enjoyed working with computers
        and logic puzzles, so combining the two into a single activity has great draw for me. Being
        able to type really, really fast doesn't hurt at all either. I'm looking forward to expanding
        my comprehension of Object-Oriented programming, as I have very little experience with such 
        languages, however I will be happy to help anyone in our cohort who requires assistance 
        with varying front end technologies,
        as my bootcamp experience gifted unto me a decent comprehension of a wide variety of 
        languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, Sass, javaScript/jQuery, Express-Handlebars,
        the MVC paradigm, React, Angular, and
        Bootstrap. You can check out my work at my portfolio <a href="https://trashy-seashore-5059.roast.io/" id="portfolioLink">here!</a>
